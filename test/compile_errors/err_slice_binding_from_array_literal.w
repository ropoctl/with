//! expect-error: cannot bind an array literal to a slice type

// #622: binding an array literal to a slice type used to be accepted and then
// bit-reinterpreted the array as a slice header (len read element[1]) — silent
// corruption and an out-of-bounds read on index. Both the []T and [T] spellings
// must be rejected.
